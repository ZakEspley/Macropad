## Components

### Mouser
[Mouser BOM](https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=d3dd1fd426)

This is enough for 2 of our macropads. These parts are currently coming from a testing stage, so the amounts of things might change.
We went with MX Cherry RGB Silent Reds but you should be able to go with whatever switches you want.

### All Electronics
All Electronics is the best place to get toggle switches, rotary encoders, and trimpots. Their stock is always shifting however so you might not be able to get the same things linked here. But you can scout around the site and see if they have anything that will work for you.

## Notes

02/072021
  
  Started by designing a simple 2x2 on the keyboard layout editor. In the video by the keyboard Layout Designer Documents there is a short youtube video that shows how to take the SVG and 3D print the plate. In the video the put the thickness to 1.5mm so that is what we will attempt first and see how that goes. They also mention in the docs that the simple MX{\_t:1} hole is the most sturdy and probably the best for free wiring without a PCB. So we went with that option too.
